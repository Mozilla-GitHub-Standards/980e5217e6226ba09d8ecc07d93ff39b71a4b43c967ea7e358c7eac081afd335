# Risk Management

The Risk Management product at Mozilla is set of lightweight processes and concise, high-quality and public documentation that we use to prioritize work and keep Mozilla safe as a whole. It spans across multiple teams (Legal, Firefox Security, Enterprise Information Security)  and was leveraged to run the 2017 Trust & Safety program (mandated by our CEO).

  > The Risk Management services allows Mozilla to take smart risks - i.e. the ability to take the best choices we can
